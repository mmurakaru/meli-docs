### Publish your tour

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Make tours available">
  Every tour within the team scope is available when initializing the tour in your app. 
  Tours located inside the private folder need to be published first to be seen by your users.
  You can find the publish action inside the edit view of a private tour. 
  Vice versa you can unpublish team tours and change the visibility to private.
